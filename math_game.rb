# Create a 2-Player math game where players take turns to answer simple math addition problems. 
# A new math question is generated for each turn by picking two numbers between 1 and 20. 
# The player whose turn it is is prompted the question and must answer correctly or lose a life.
# Both players start with 3 lives. 
# They lose a life if they mis-answer a question. 
# At the end of every turn, the game should output the new scores for both players
# The game when one of the players loses all their lives. 
# The game should announce who won and what the winnerâ€™s score is.

# Nouns: game, player, question, score, winner
# Roles:
# game - would be the class that encompasses everything else
# player - would be to initialize the players, ensuring there are only 2
# question - will be used to generate the numbers for each turn between 1 and 20
# score - will determine how many lives each player has, displayed after each turn
# winner - would be executed once a player has reached 0 lives and will show winner's score
